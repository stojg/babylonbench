# BabylonBench

This is sort of a local version of the BabylonJS playground to quickly test and build stuff with your favourite editor outside of your project.

This project is using yarn, so `yarn install` and `yarn start` is your friends.

To modify and or create a scene, modify the `CreateScene` function in `src/index.tsx`
